# Bit Magic
## Introduction
Some mathematical calculations can be done using things like bit shift operations and raw type castings utilizing base 2 maths. This is much faster than using division or a finite sum. **Most of these functions do not give the best possible solution but a very good estimation. Don't use these if you need mathematically correct<sup>[1](#footnote_math_correct)</sup> values.**
