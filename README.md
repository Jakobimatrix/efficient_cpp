# efficient_cpp

## Description
The main argument to programm in cpp is:
*Its close to the hardware so it must be fast.*
The thing is, this is only true if you do it *right*, whatever that means...

I use cpp since 2013 and am now on a point where I cannot remember every fancy detail so I thought about creating something where I can fast search for a specific thing I have learned. But I dont want to create tutorials, there are already enough out there done by people far more competent. Instead this should be a glossar linking every *problem* (I encountered) to the a tutorial site. Here I try to find tutorials which are **on point**:
Problem --> Solution
does/dontâ€™s  --> Example
Much like the [CppCoreGuidelines](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines.html) I will try to summarize with as little words as possible.
That being said if one has the time and endurence to digest the details good reading material or talks will be separately liked too. I try to add a tldr in thouse cases.

**Disclamer**
Most things will **not** be based on my experience but rather on the trust that who ever told me do that and this knows his cpp. I am not an expert (yet).

Contributions are welcome!

## Before you throw every optimization onto your code base
1. There are some things you can and should always do. These are covered in **basics**. 
2. Don't reinvent the wheel: Use well established existing **libraries**. These are already optimized by people who know probably better.
3. **First** write clean code<sup>[1](#footnote_clean_code)</sup> **Second** write good tests **Third** validate if optimization is needed **Forth** profile the program, don't do blind optimization **Fifth** optimize. **Sixth** Check if Tests still work.

<a name="footnote_clean_code">1</a>: *clean code* is a topic on its own with a lot of discussion and different opinions. Not tackled here.
