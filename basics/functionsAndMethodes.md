# Functions/Methodes
This is about calling functions and methodes as well a passing and returning variables. Optimizing via keywords can be found in [Basics/keywords.md](keywords.md).

## Passing multiple variables
Depending on the architecture there is a limit of how many variables can be loaded into a function without the need of saving them onto the heap.
**Pass multiple variables inside a struct/object especially if they are always passed together through multiple functions/methods.**
